/**
 * OPTIONAL Pro Mode Assignment
 *
 * The below function will produce a couple of different numbers.
 *
 * For this assignment, work through the code without the use of the computer.
 * The objective is to think critically about how the code is executed and
 * see if you can figure out what the answer is for each of the two undefined variables.
 * This will require you to stretch your understanding of how functions, scope,
 * and variables work.
 *
 * This is a very difficult assignment for your first week with Javascript,
 * so don't get frustrated if you test the code out, and don't come to the same
 * conclusion as the code did. Instead, try to work through why the answers are
 * the way they are. If you got them right, then you should order up some
 * pizza and celebrate your understanding of these difficult topics!
